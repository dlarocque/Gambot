# Gambot

Discord bot that tracks members' interactions in a server and awards them points accordingly.
The points that members earn through their interactions with others can then be gambled in a **deathroll** game!

In the future, I plan on adding a shop where users can spend their points on roles, as well as leaderboards where users can flex their virtual currencies to their friends.

## Want To Use This Bot?
If, for some reason you are interested in adding this bot to your server, see setup.txt for a quick guide on how to run this bot wherever you want.
This bot was made with the intention of being semi-private, so you're going to have to set it up to run on your own, I've tried making it easy to do so for my own sake though.

## Issues
If you encounter an issue as a user, or developer, **please** submit an issue on this GitHub page so that I can fix it right away.  Try to break the bot!
